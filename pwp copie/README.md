## PWP Milestone 2 feedback

Your content strategy may need some work. A few more details in each of the sections would be beneficial for the purposes of development and content creation. While you state your end goal as a developer, you lack a few details on the content itself as well as some of your functionality. Although the detail is lacking, there is still enough information here to get you going on development of your site if you haven't done so already.

If you need additional resourcers for the development aspects of your project, feel free to reach out to the instructors so that we may guide you in the direction of some functionality you may be seeking. Continue on moving forward with the development of your PWP. Keep up the good work!

This passes at Tier III.
